Q: I try to get the project to compile but I get compile errors about Unit Tests. What’s going on?


A: The AdvanceMathUnitTest part of the Project is purely for testing and it requires a library to compile called NUnit. It is not necessary to run the Demo or Compile the library you can do two things to solve this (in Visual Studios 2005):

Right click on AdvanceMathUnitTest and the select remove. Then it 
should compile. 

Or you could right click on Physics2DDemo and then select debug->start 
new instance. 



Q: Where is the Documentation?

A: The library itself is well commented using C#’s XML comments these comments are easily accessed via intellisense. But I do plan to add tutorials. You can specifically ask for a tutorial on the Discussion page and I will try to make one for you.
